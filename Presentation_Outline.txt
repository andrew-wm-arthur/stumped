Programming Language Concepts Final Project
*** Artificial Neural Networks in Scala ***


+What is Machine Learning
	Classification, Regressionsion
	Training on Data
	(MNIST data set?)

+Artificial Neural Networks
	Feed Forward Networks
	(Perceptrons?)
	Structure
		Input, Output layers
		Hidden Layers
	Training a Vector of Weights
	(Relationship to Gradient Descent?)

+Exploiting Functional Programming
	List oriented programming
		Pattern Matching and Recursion -> correctness
	Tail Recursion
		Increases efficiency -> decreases training time
	Using Higher Order Functions
		Cost Functions
			Mean Squared Error
			Regularization
			(Radial Basis Functions?)
		Sigmoid Functions
			EXP form
			Tanh
